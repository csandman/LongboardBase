Complex (39? L x 9? W x 27.5? WB)

If you want a longboard that feels a little shorter than it truly is, check out the Complex.  Basically the big brother the the Spliff, the up-turned nose wedges the front truck for additional turning prowess and the big (I mean BIG) tail makes popping over curbs a breeze.  Grab this deck and head on down to the shore for an simply Complex afternoon or cruising and carving!

Talking points: Big Big tail, wedged nose, plenty of foot space


THE EVOLUTION OF OUR VISION 
The pride of Bustin Boards, this board is the most versatile board on the market today. Its unique shape is meant to add performance to comfort. The centrally dispersed concave grips your feet, while the springy camber rebounds with just the right flex. Its long wheel base makes it feel like a much longer cruiser, but its innovative contours make it turn like a carving board. 

A great first board, the Complex carves like a dream but it stable at moderated speeds. If you looking for a board that can do anything and is just strait fun to ride, this is it. 

Note: To avoid wheelbite, we do not recommend using wheels larger then 70mm on the Complex.


"The Bustin complex board is the sickest riding experience I have ever had. Nothing can compare to the Bustin complex. I've ridden many different long boards but this tops the list by far. I had the sector nine, loaded, and many other long boards and this one is my favorite. So trust me if you want a long board get a Bustin long board, you wont regret it!"

"Just wanted to shoot you guys an email letting you know how awesome the new Complex is. I've ridden a lot of my friend's boards and I have to say this board has felt better than any of them. If (and when) I eventually decide to get another board, I'm definitely going Bustin'. Thanks guys."
