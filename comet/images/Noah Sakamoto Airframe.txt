AIR FRAME TECHNOLOGY BY COMET SKATEBOARDS. 
Air Frame is a patented construction that was developed by skateboarding legend Paul Schmitt.  Air Frame technology is based on multiple hollow torsion boxes sandwiched between solid plies of hard maple.  The result is a lighter board and that stiffer and more responsive through pre tensioned, corrugated maple plies.
