            <h3>How to Get Cheap Hardware</h3>
            <p>Mounting hardware tends to be overpriced due to brand-names, which is why I buy my hardware at my local hardware store.  For this listing, I used a random site called BoltDepot.com to illustrate my point.  If you're not sure about the shop you're purchasing from, make sure to bring a bolt and nut from any other set of standard hardware to make sure everything fits correctly.</p>
            <p>Most of the terms listed here should be recognized by a store worker who really knows his fasteners.  Bring pictures along or ask an experienced worker if you need help.</p>

            <h4>Mounting Screws</h4>
            <p>Number 10-32 screw (US -not metric)<br>
                <a href="http://www.boltdepot.com/Machine_screws_Phillips_pan_head_Stainless_steel_18-8_10-32.aspx" class="imgScanned">Pan-head (Machine-Head)</a> / <a href="http://www.boltdepot.com/Machine_screws_Phillips_truss_head_Stainless_steel_18-8_10-32.aspx" class="imgScanned">Truss Head</a> / <a href="http://www.boltdepot.com/Socket_cap_Stainless_steel_18-8_10-32.aspx">Socket-Cap</a> / <a href="http://www.boltdepot.com/Machine_screws_Phillips_flat_head_Stainless_steel_18-8_10-32.aspx">Flat Head (Counter-sink)</a>

                (Stainless Steel 18-8)<br>
                (Most counter-sink does not use standard skate size Allen-wrench.  5-32 should be the right size Allen-wrench.)</p>
            <h4>Mounting Nuts</h4>
            <p><a href="http://www.boltdepot.com/Product-Details.aspx?product=2553" class="imgScanned">Number 10-32 nut with nylon insert</a><br>
                use 3/8" wrench  </p>
            <h4>Drop-Through Washers for mounting</h4>
            <p><a href="http://www.boltdepot.com/Product-Details.aspx?product=2946">Number 10 washer</a></p>
            <h4>8mm Axle Nuts</h4>

            <p><a href="http://www.boltdepot.com/Product-Details.aspx?product=2555">5/16 nut with nylon insert</a><br>
                use 1/2" wrench  </p>

            <h4>Kingpin Bolt (For a Reverse-Kingpin Truck)</h4>

            <p><a href="http://www.boltdepot.com/Hex_bolts_Zinc_plated_grade_8_steel_yellow_3_8-24.aspx">3/8-24 bolt (length should be 2.5 to 3 inches) Grade-8 Steel</a></p>

            <h4>Kingpin Nut</h4>

            <p><a href="http://www.boltdepot.com/Product-Details.aspx?product=4110">3/8-24 nut with nylon insert</a><br>
                use 9/16" wrench  </p>

            <h4>Barrel Bushing Flat Washer Size</h4>

            <p><a href="http://www.boltdepot.com/Product-Details.aspx?product=7676">5/16" inner diameter x 1" Wide x 1/16" thick washer</a><br>
                Might be called a "Fender Washer"  </p>

            <h4>Cone Bushing Washer Size</h4>

            <p>5/16th inner diameter X 7/8" Wide x 1/16" thick washer<br>
                Might be called a "Fender Washer"  </p>



            <p>On the subject of head shapes on mounting hardware, I have preferences that I would like to explain here.  My two favorite types are either Truss heads or Socket Caps.  With the truss style, there is a wider area where the pressure is distributed underneath the head which greatly reduces damage to the deck.  I prefer socket caps because the allen-wrench socket is much deeper and more difficult to damage than a Phillips-head.  My Phillips heads get stripped when they get slammed against the pavement, but the socket caps survive.  You will want to use washers underneath the heads unless it's a drop-through.</p>



            <h4>For determining the length of hardware you need, I would use this moderately safe estimate.</h4>

            <p>1<sup>1/4</sup> in + Riser Height<br>
                or if you want it to be a tight fit (thicker decks be warned),<br>
                1 in + Riser Height  </p>


            <p>I hope this helps some of you to get skate supplies on an affordable and customizable level.</p>

            <h3 class="borderTop">Bushing Selection</h3>
            <p>Bushings are urethane cushions that provide both the suspension 
                and turning resistance for your trucks. Bushings come in a wide 
                variety of shapes and durometers that can dramatically affect how
                your trucks perform. There is no right or wrong way to customize
                your bushings – ultimately it depends on your personal preference,
                weight, and style of riding. Check out our recommendations below
                if you are starting your journey towards the perfect set up.</p>
            <h4>Bushing Shapes</h4>
            <img alt='' src="https://d3ol6qpodzlgj8.cloudfront.net/cdn/farfuture/eh7SlJdnfkPFHvAmzu-22W8c5WPrD9KD7F-TdMBaLog/mtime:1395700358/sites/default/files/content/bushing-guide/bushing-shapes.jpg" />
            <p>Bushings can be divided into four key categories; Cones, Barrels, Stepped Cones (Barricles), and Double Stepped (Eliminators).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cone:</strong> Conical shaped bushings offer limited resistance, making them ideal for carving.</li>
                <li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Cylindrical in shape, barrel bushings offer great stability and good resistance for carving, freeriding, and downhill.</li>
                <li><strong>Stepped Cone (Freeride, Barricle):</strong> Designed for freeriding the stepped cone offers more stability than a barrel but is less restrictive than an eliminator.</li>
                <li><strong>Double Stepped (Eliminator):</strong> These bushings limit the trucks range of motion but are great if you are looking for stability. This bushing is the most stable and most restrictive of all four shapes. Great for both freeride and downhill set ups.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Rider Weight</h4>
            <img alt='' src="https://d3ol6qpodzlgj8.cloudfront.net/cdn/farfuture/d9JuyMEhCK06V20T4DYHZ2PSsYYXdks0RGPY9HEB2rc/mtime:1395703237/sites/default/files/content/bushing-guide/atlas-weight-guide.jpg" />
            <p class="borderBottom">Bushing durometer designates the hardness of the urethane used in
                the bushing. Durometers can range from 60a all the way to 100a,
                the larger the number the harder the bushing. Harder bushings are
                more restrictive and can be more stable at speed. Softer bushings 
                offer less resistance making them better for turn ability but less
                stable at speed. Keep in mind that stability and turn ability are
                affected proportionally by both the bushings shape and durometer.
                We can provide basic guidelines for choosing the right combination
                but experimentation is the best way to figure out what’s right for you.</p>
